### **Svelte:**

```javascript
npm create svelte@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

**Svelte:** is built on Svelte, a UI framework that uses a compiler to let you write breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser, using languages you already know â€” HTML, CSS and JavaScript. **It's a love letter to web development.**

### Postman:

### **requests in Postman**

You can send requests in Postman to connect to APIs you are working with. Your requests can retrieve, add, delete, and update data. Whether you are building or testing your own API, or integrating with a third-party API, you can send your requests in Postman. Your requests can send parameters, authorization details, and any body data you require.

For example, if you're building a client application (such as a mobile or web app) for a store, you might send one request to retrieve the list of available products, another request to create a new order (including the selected product details), and a different request to log a customer in to their account.

When you send a request, Postman displays the response received from the API server in a way that lets you examine, visualize, and if necessary troubleshoot it.
